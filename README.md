# Texas Hold'em poker (texasholdem-java)

## Introduction

This project has been created as a platform to experiment with a Texas Hold'em poker game in Java.

Its primary goal is to offer a clean, open source Texas Hold'em poker engine in Java. The game engine strives to follow the famous Robert's Rules of Poker as closely as possible. In order to test the game engine, the project also offers a Swing GUI and bots.
